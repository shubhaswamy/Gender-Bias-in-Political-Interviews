# Using Language Models to Quantify Gender Bias in Recent American Election Journalism

#### Abstract
Gender bias is an increasingly prominent topic when it comes to American elections. In this thesis, I produce quantifiable metrics using
Natural Language Processing techniques to explore the variation in
questions posed by journalists to female and male candidates in recent
American elections. The analysis uses a bigram language model and
perplexities to determine if there is statistical significance in proving
that questions asked by reporters to political candidates vary by gender. The dataset includes a gender-balanced set of in media interviews
for congressional, senate, and presidential candidates from 2014-2020.
The results suggest that questions asked to male candidates are more
elections and policy-related than those asked to female candidates.
